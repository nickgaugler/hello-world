# hello-world
My first Github Repository

Hello Github World.  My name is Nick and I love to code.  It started when I was young playing basic computer games on a hand-me-down Apple computer.  But the journey has taken me from HTML pages to advanced Python dashboards.  I can't wait to see my path forward.
